                            The primary aim of AUSMUN 2024 is to provide a dynamic platform for delegates to engage in diplomatic discourse and negotiation, embodying the evolving partnership between Australia and India.

Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi. By delving into the multifaceted relationship between India and Australia, AUSMUN aims to shed light on their pivotal roles in various spheres, including military alliances like QUAD, sports, cinema, technology transfer, skill development, and education. AUSMUN serves as a testament to the shared democratic values, economic engagement, and increasing high-level interactions that form the foundation of the bilateral ties between India and Australia.
